  Thanks for opening this pull request!
  We have detected this is the first time you have contributed
  to *sMRIPost-LINC*.
  We ask you to read through the Contributing Guide:
  https://github.com/pennlinc/xcp_d/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

  These are guidelines intended to make communication easier by describing a consistent process, but
  don't worry if you don't get it everything exactly "right" on the first try.

  To boil it down, here are some highlights:

  1.  Consider starting a conversation in the issues list before submitting a pull request.
      The discussion might save you a lot of time coding.
  2.  Any code you submit will be licensed under the same terms (BSD 3-Clause) as the rest of xcp_d.

  A pull request is a conversation. We may ask you to make some changes before accepting your PR,
  and likewise, you should feel free to ask us any questions you have.
